/**
 * Entity defining an event.
 *
 * An event is a combination of a list of actions (click, swipe, pause) and a list of conditions to fulfill in order to
 * execute those actions. It has a relation "one to many" with [ActionEntity], which is represented in
 * [CompleteEventEntity]. It also as another "one to many" relation with [ConditionEntity], also represented in
 * [CompleteEventEntity].
 *
 * It is always associated to a [ScenarioEntity] via its foreign key [EventEntity.scenarioId]. Deletion of a
 * scenario will lead to the automatic deletion of all events with the same scenarioId.
 *
 * To get the complete event with its actions and conditions, you can use [CompleteEventEntity].
 *
 * @param id unique identifier for an event. Also the primary key in the table.
 * @param scenarioId identifier of this event's scenario. Reference the key [ScenarioEntity.id] in scenario_table.
 * @param name name of this event.
 * @param conditionOperator the operator to apply to all [ConditionEntity] related to this click. Can be any value
 *                          of [com.buzbuz.smartautoclicker.domain.ConditionOperator].
 * @param priority the order in the scenario. Lowest priority will always be checked first when detecting.
 * @param stopAfter the number of executions of this click after which the scenario is stopped. Null if the scenario is
 *                  always continued after this click.
