/**
 * Detects [ClickInfo] on a display.
 *
 * In order to detect, you must start recording the screen to get images to detect on, this can be done by calling
 * [startScreenRecord]. Then, to take a screenshot of the screen, you can use [captureArea]. Or, you can start the
 * detection of a list of [ClickInfo] by using [startDetection].
 * The states of the recording and the detection are available in [isScreenRecording] and [isDetecting] respectively.
 * Once you no longer needs to capture or detect, call [stopDetection] or [stop] to release all processing resources.
 *
 * @param context the Android context.
 * @param bitmapSupplier provides the bitmap for the given path, width and height. This call will be made on the
 * processing thread, so you can use it directly to perform the loading from the memory, but keep in mind that the more
 * time this thread spend here, the slower the detection will be.
