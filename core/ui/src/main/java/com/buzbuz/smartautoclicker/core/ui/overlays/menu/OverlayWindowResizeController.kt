/**
 * Controls the resize of an overlay window.
 *
 * As the root view of an overlay window can't be animated during a resize trigger automatically via the xml attribute
 * animateLayoutChanges, we need to manually handle it.
 * To fix this issue, we use a [maximumSize] for our window, which will be the biggest width and height it can take in
 * all ui states. Before a size transition, the window will be set to this maximum value, allowing the
 * [backgroundViewGroup] and it's content to be correctly animated. Once the auto resize animation is completed, the
 * window size is set back to the size of it's content.
 * For obvious reason, the root view of the window should be transparent, and should only contain one view, the
 * [backgroundViewGroup].
 *
 * @param backgroundViewGroup the view displaying the background of the overlay
 * @param resizedContainer the view originally resized and that triggers the window resizing.
 * @param maximumSize the maximum width and height the window can have between all its states.
 * @param windowSizeListener called when the window needs to be resized.
